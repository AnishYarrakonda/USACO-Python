# USACO

Practice solutions for USACO-style competitive programming problems, organized by week/topic plus extra practice sets.

## Structure
- `Week 1` through `Week 13` folders by training topic
- `Extra Practice/` grouped alphabetically by problem names

Each file is generally one standalone problem solution.

## Run a solution
From `usaco/`, run any file directly, for example:

```bash
python3 "Week 1 Simulation/magic_trick.py"
python3 "Extra Practice/G-H/hps.py"
```

## Notes
- Most scripts expect standard input in the format required by the problem statement.
- Filenames correspond to the specific problem being solved.
